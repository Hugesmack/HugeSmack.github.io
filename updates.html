    <b>-November 19th, 2019:</b> Chat has a fresh new color scheme. Go check it out!<br>
    <b>-November 19th, 2019:</b> Hehe we back ;) <br>
    <b>-November 19th, 2019:</b> The site got blocked :(<br>
    <b>-November 15th, 2019:</b> Agar.io is back!!! Also added diep.io.<br>
    <b>-November 3rd, 2019:</b> If there is a blocked <b><i>flash game</b></i> that you would like to play, email us the name of the game + the blocked link. We may be able to host the game locally, so that you can play it unblocked at school. This is an advanced technique, and requested games will likely take a few days to be added. If we can not add the game you request we will let you know by email.<br>
    <b>-November 3rd, 2019:</b> Big Smacky will soon have a minecraft server! When its ready, you will be able to find it on the "minecraft server" tab.<br>
    <b>-November 1st, 2019:</b> Added Core Ball back to the site.<br>
    <b>-November 1st, 2019:</b> Many people reached out to let us know that the Papa's games links were not working. Thank you for this feedback! It helped us to quickly address the issue, and the links are now fixed!<br>
    <b>-November 1st, 2019:</b> We've re-added some old games that got blocked, as well as some new ones! Learn to fly 2 and 3, Bloons Tower Defense 5, and the google dino game are all on the games tab now.<br>
    <b>-October 31th, 2019:</b> Happy Halloween!ðŸŽƒðŸ’€<br>
    <b>-October 30th, 2019:</b> Big update! The tab system has been reformatted, you will find that there are now two new pages on the site. 'Papa's Games' and 'Papa's Games Desktop'. These are a list of the Papa-eria games formatted for chromebooks and desktops respectively. You may also notice that the order of tabs from left to right is slightly different.<br>
    <b>-October 25th, 2019:</b> Agar.io was blocked! We deleted it from the games list and moved JackSmith to its place. Please contact us if you know of an unblocked agar.io link!<br>
    <b>-October 24th, 2019:</b> All of the messages from October 24th or earlier were deleted from the group chat. This should significantly reduce the lag that some users were experiencing. If the last message you sent in the groupchat was before the 24th, you may not recieve notifications until you send another.<br>
    <b>-October 23rd, 2019:</b> We've removed or replaced all of the blocked links. Every game, as of typing this, is unblocked *including Super Smash*<br> 
    <b>-October 18th, 2019:</b> We've fixed the issue of that caused the menu to open new tabs.<br>	
    <b>-October 15th, 2019:</b> We now have tabs at the top and bottom of this page that link to various sites. This keeps Big Smacky organized and keeps the site from looking ugly.<br>	
    <b>-October 7th, 2019:</b> We've got a new address, but that doesn't matter, cause you're always home at Big Smacky's. So pick up where you left off: playing games and having fun. Let your freinds know we're back, and remember: the school may have tried to shut us down, but NO ONE can hold Big Smacky down!</p>
